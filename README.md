Pulsar - An Open Source .Net 3D Game Engine
=======

Pulsar is a plugin based 3D game engine based on C# and OpenTK.
The Engine is derived from the Open Source project [Duality](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality), and wouldnt have been possible without it!
And for Rendering we use a .net port of Three.js

If you have questions or just want to say Hi, feel free to check out the [discussions](https://github.com/michaelsakharov/Pulsar/discussions) area, or join us in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7aye6vhwS7). Also, feedback is always welcome!

### Building From Source

If you want to build Pulsar yourself, you can do so using Visual Studio by simply opening `Duality.sln` and selecting "Build Solution".

All framework build results will be located in the shared `Build/Output` folder. Sample project build results will be separate, and located in their respective `Content/Plugins` subdirectories. To launch any of the included sample projects after building Duality, select it as a startup project in your IDE. Otherwise, you can use either `DualityEditor` or `DualityLauncher` as a startup project.
You may also need to place the 'Renderers' Folder into the 'Build/Output' manually, this will eventually be improved by moving them into Embedded Resources.
